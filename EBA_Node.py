# BUFFER REQUEST
# buffer request, size (in bytes) (-1 is infinity)
# ex. BUFREQ -1
# response will have "ACK" next along with the buffer name and space
# ex. BUFREQ ACK BUF1 1000
# (you didn't get an infinite amount of space, just 1000 bytes)
# or REJ if rejected
# ex BUFREQ REJ
# and of course this is gonna be a dictionary in python.
